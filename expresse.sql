Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list.

Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-revenues or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual''s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual''s true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled. \r\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of individuals are included only if those individuals'' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars.
